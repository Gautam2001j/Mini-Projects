# Mini-Projects

To run C files you must have the compiler on your system,
I am using the gcc compiler, you can use anyone whether you want to use turbo C/C++ or any,
For compiling the code open the command prompt,
Then go the directory where the C program is saved,
Then compile this program on command prompt "gcc -o File_Name File_Name.c"
After that code compilation is completed
To run the program on command prompt "./FileName"
